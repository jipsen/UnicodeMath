# Flexible math notation

We all have our favorite way to write mathematical expressions, and when we need to read mathematics, 
it would be convenient to be able to be able to consistently modify the notation that is used in an article
in order to make it more readable for ourselves. 

How could such a system be designed? 

What are useful parameters that a reader could custumize?

...

To make some progress, let's start with listing some variations in mathematical/logical syntax (using latex when appropriate):

Quantifiers: \forall, \exists | for all, there exists | for all, for some | AA, EE | (_), 

Allow a list of variables after a quantifier: Variable separator: "," | " "
